# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

Welcome to this regex tutorial! In this guide, we'll delve into the details of a specific regular expression, explaining each component and its functionality. Regular expressions (commonly known as regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and searching within strings. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of the regex pattern and how it can be used.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll explore a regex pattern that matches email addresses. The regex pattern provides an effective way to validate and extract email addresses from text.

^([A-Za-z0-9]+)@([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.com$

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

n regards to this expression, the `^` marks the start of the expression and the `$` marks the end of the expression.The `^` anchor asserts the start of a line and it ensures that the email address starts at the beginning of a line. The `$` anchor asserts the end of a line and it ensures that the email address ends at the end of a line.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define how many times a character or group should appear. The `{1,}` quantifier in our regex means "one or more" occurrences of the previous character or group.


### Grouping & Capturing

Parentheses `()` are used for grouping and capturing. We'll use `( )` to capture the username part of the email address.


### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, allow us to define a set of characters that we want to match. In our regex pattern, [A-Za-z0-9] is a bracket expression that matches any uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit. This is used to match both the username and the domain parts of the email address.

### Character Classes

Character classes allow us to specify a set of characters that should match. In our regex, we'll use `[A-Za-z0-9]` to match alphanumeric characters.

Character classes define a range of characters that can match a single character in the input text. In our pattern, [A-Za-z0-9]+ specifies that we are looking for one or more alphanumeric characters. This is used to match both the username and the domain in the email address.

### The OR Operator

The OR operator, represented by the pipe symbol `|`, allows us to specify alternatives. In our pattern, there's no explicit OR operator, but the usage of [A-Za-z0-9] in multiple places implies that either an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit can be matched.

### Flags

Flags in regex are used to modify the behavior of the pattern matching. In our pattern, we're not using any flags like case-insensitivity or global matching. The flags would come after the closing delimiter.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes allow us to match characters with special meanings in regex. In our pattern, we're not using any character escapes like `\` followed by a character with special meaning.
